# Spotify-Project

## Introduction
This is the final project of our [**Advanced Programming**](https://github.com/Advanced-Programming-1401) course in Shahid Beheshti University. It's a clone of the famous music-streaming application **Spotify** designed using **Java** programming language.<br>
From [here](), you can acces the project documentation as well.







## Objectives
Here is a list of concepts which where used through out the project:
- Using OOP concepts
- Database design
- Multithreading concepts
- Socket Programming
- Data encryption
- Designing graphical user interface with JavaFX

## Pre Requirements
- Java
- SQLITE
- JavaFX
- Netbeans / IntelliJ as an IDE
- Ant / Gradle as a build system for the projec
  
## UML Design

## Implementation
The project has 2 main part:<br>
1. `SpotifyClient` <br>
2. `SpotifyServer` package which handles the requests sent from the client and responds properly. It's worth of mention that dealing with database is on the server-side of the project as well.
- `SpotifyClient`
This is the package that is considered to be the interface/app layer of the project. It's repsonsible for getting input from a client, sending it through a socket to the server and waiting for a proper response. 
- `SpotifyServer`
The server is responsible for reading the requests from each clinet, either respoend directly or acces the database using `DBManager` class methods and then, responding back to the client. It's worth noting that the server is multithreaded, which means it can handle dealing with multiple reqeusets as well. Also a server log a printed to the terminal to show what the server is doint at the moment.
- Sockets
It's worth noting that all the data passed between each client and the server is done through the use of sockets. In fact, each request from the client is sent to the socket, then server receives it and responds properly **through the same socket** for each client.

## Creating GUI
The main tool for designing graphical user interface for this project is [JavaFX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX).

## Database Structures











## Presentation 
[This](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Pqmx_Ug9YLieOzJ7dPYiVqc6WX6ZsMPkJ6riUVkjj8/edit?usp=sharing) is the link to the slides used for project presentation.

## How to run the code?
From branch `netbeans`, clone the the 2 derectories `SpotifyServer` and `SpotifyClient` to your local machine, then (using netbeans), first run the `SpotifyServer` first, you shall see a `Listening ...` massage, then open `SpotifyClient` and run it, you shall see a window pop-up, a login page. Now you are good to go =) .
